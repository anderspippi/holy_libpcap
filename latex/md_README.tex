This directory contains source code for libpcap, a system-\/independent interface for user-\/level packet capture. libpcap provides a portable framework for low-\/level network monitoring. Applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging, etc. Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, and since we\textquotesingle{}ve developed several tools that require this functionality, we\textquotesingle{}ve created this system-\/independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several system-\/dependent packet capture modules in each application.

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Support for particular platforms and BPF}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
For some platforms there are {\ttfamily README.\{system\}} files that discuss issues with the OS\textquotesingle{}s interface for packet capture on those platforms, such as how to enable support for that interface in the OS, if it\textquotesingle{}s not built in by default.

The libpcap interface supports a filtering mechanism based on the architecture in the BSD packet filter. BPF is described in the 1993 Winter Usenix paper \`{}`The BSD Packet Filter\+: A New Architecture for User-\/level Packet Capture'\textquotesingle{} (\href{https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z}{\texttt{ compressed Post\+Script}}, \href{https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.gz}{\texttt{ gzipped Post\+Script}}, \href{https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf}{\texttt{ PDF}}).

Although most packet capture interfaces support in-\/kernel filtering, libpcap utilizes in-\/kernel filtering only for the BPF interface. On systems that don\textquotesingle{}t have BPF, all packets are read into user-\/space and the BPF filters are evaluated in the libpcap library, incurring added overhead (especially, for selective filters). Ideally, libpcap would translate BPF filters into a filter program that is compatible with the underlying kernel subsystem, but this is not yet implemented.

BPF is standard in 4.\+4\+BSD, BSD/\+OS, Net\+BSD, Free\+BSD, Open\+BSD, Dragon\+Fly BSD, mac\+OS, and Solaris 11; an older, modified and undocumented version is standard in AIX. \{DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, Tru64 UNIX\} uses the packetfilter interface but has been extended to accept BPF filters (which libpcap utilizes).

Linux has a number of BPF based systems, and libpcap does not support any of the e\+BPF mechanisms as yet, although it supports many of the memory mapped receive mechanisms. See the \href{doc/README.linux}{\texttt{ Linux-\/specific README}} for more information.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Note to Linux distributions and $\ast$\+BSD systems that include libpcap\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
There\textquotesingle{}s now a rule to make a shared library, which should work on Linux and $\ast$\+BSD, among other platforms.

It sets the soname of the library to {\ttfamily libpcap.\+so.\+1}; this is what it should be, {\bfseries{NOT}} {\ttfamily libpcap.\+so.\+1.\+x} or {\ttfamily libpcap.\+so.\+1.\+x.\+y} or something such as that.

We\textquotesingle{}ve been maintaining binary compatibility between libpcap releases for quite a while; there\textquotesingle{}s no reason to tie a binary linked with libpcap to a particular release of libpcap.
